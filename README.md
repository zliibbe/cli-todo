# CLI Task Manager (todo App)
A simple Task Manager CLI tool that uses commands to Create, View, Update, or Delete todos built using NodeJS and MongoDB as the database.

## Dependencies
* [Commander.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander): This helps us to build the CLI tool.

* [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk): This makes messages in the terminal colorful and easy to read.

* [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer): This lets us ask the user for input.

* [ora](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ora): This makes the terminal show nice spinning animations.

## Documentation

This repo makes use of this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nodejs-tutorial-build-a-task-manager-cli-tool/).

As this project uses MongoDB, I found this documentation for [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/get-started-with-mongodb-atlas/) particularly helpful.
